# DementiaCare

#About the Project:
Being a physical therapist, I wanted to create something that solved a lot of caregiver's and family problems of taking care of their loved one with dementia. I wanted to make a simple website that allows you to click on a behavior and then give you ways to manage it. 

##Built With:
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Bootstrap
-Animate.style

##What I would do differently
I would add a section for medications, maybe use an API for it, and also a section for caregiver notes and then be able to print them out. Something I will be working on in the future is adding React for the styled components.
